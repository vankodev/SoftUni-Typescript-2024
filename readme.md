# SoftUni TypeScript Coursework

This repository contains the exercises and projects completed during the **TypeScript** course at **SoftUni**, which took place in **April 2024**. The course covered both fundamental and advanced TypeScript features, focusing on static typing, object-oriented programming (OOP), generics, modules, and decorators, while offering hands-on experience through a final project.

## Course Overview

The **TypeScript** course dives deep into one of the most popular languages for building both server-side and front-end applications. Created by Microsoft, TypeScript enhances JavaScript with **static typing**, allowing for more robust and maintainable code. The course not only introduces basic types and structures but also emphasizes **OOP** principles using TypeScriptâ€”working with classes, inheritance, abstraction, interfaces, and generics. Additionally, the course explores advanced features like modules and decorators, culminating in a workshop where all knowledge is applied to building a complete TypeScript application.

## Skills Acquired

- **Static Typing**: Mastery of working with statically typed data in TypeScript.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Understanding OOP principles and applying them in TypeScript.
- **Classes and Interfaces**: Utilizing TypeScript classes, interfaces, and generics to build scalable applications.
- **Modules and Decorators**: Managing complex projects with modules and enhancing code with decorators.
- **Application Development**: Building end-to-end applications using TypeScript.

## Course Structure

- **Introduction to TypeScript**: Basics of TypeScript, from installation to core features.
- **Advanced Data Types and Interfaces**: Exploring complex types and using interfaces for type safety.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Building with classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
- **Generics**: Implementing reusable components with generics.
- **Modules and Namespaces**: Organizing code into maintainable modules and namespaces.
- **Decorators**: Using decorators to modify behavior dynamically.
